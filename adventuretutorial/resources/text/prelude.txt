You awaken in a damp and dark cave.
The last thing you remember was wandering through the woods near town 
when a sharp pain burst from the back of your head.
In your last moments of consciousness 
you recall hearing the deep bellowing laughter of an Ogre!
You stand up, brush the dirt off your clothes, grab the nearest rock,
and swear to escape this dreadful place alive!

You see two paths before you. 'Which one is the way out?', you wonder.
